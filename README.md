# A smart App to recommend movies in Arabic language
This is a structured app that has many modules in it, as the name suggested this app intended to help the arab audience into having an arabic movie recommendation system based on the features extracting from the user.

# Recommendation System

The frustrating thing about Dart that there is no functional framework that one can work with to build a recommendation system with much of accuracy, So that I built by myself the model for the recommendation, the model measures the distance between the user's feature vector θ and the movie features X then recommend the least Euclidean distance to make the recommendation, Hence this system can be considered as Content-Based recommender system.


# Archeticture

The system uses the help of Flutter framework to make the recommendations for the arab audience, the good thing about flutter that it is native and genuine, Hence the compiled code is native in the paltforms that it operates on, you can use the code provided to develop on it the system.

# Survey

There is a servey at the start of the app, this servey intends to extract the feature vector θ of the user to make the recommendations.
